# [Amazon SNS](http://aws.amazon.com/sns/) Input for [Mozilla Heka](http://hekad.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

A Mozilla Heka Input for Amazon Web Services SNS.

The Amazon SNS input will start a webserver on the given port and act as an endpoint for consuming topic messages per the [API instructions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SendMessageToHttp.html).

Notification messages generated from the Amazon SNS Input will have a message type of `amazon.sns.notification`.
Subscription messages `amazon.sns.subscription` and unsubscribe notifications `amazon.sns.unsubscribe`.
